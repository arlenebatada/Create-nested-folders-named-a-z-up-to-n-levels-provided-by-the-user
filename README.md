# Create-nested-folders-named-a-z-up-to-n-levels-provided-by-the-user
Suppose you want to create folders named from A to Z, add another folders named from A-Z in A, also add folders named from A-Z in B and so on upto Z. What if you want to create these 26 folders up to n levels? Creating them manually will be practically insane. This problem is not an imaginary one, rather has showed up in real life in an event named "e treasure hunt" in my college. So, I thought of creating this program which lets you create these folders upto the levels the user provides.
